Simple and pragmatic migrations for Go applications.

## Features
- Super simple driver interface to allow easy implementation for more database/migration drivers.
- Embeddable migration files.
- Support for up/down migrations.
- Atomic migrations (where possible, depending on database support).
- Support for using Go code as migrations

## Drivers
- Apache Phoenix
- Golang (runs generic go functions)
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

## Quickstart
```go
// Create migration source
assetMigration := &migration.AssetMigrationSource{
    Asset:    Asset,
    AssetDir: AssetDir,
    Dir:      "test-migrations",
}

// Create driver
driver, err := phoenix.New("http://localhost:8765")

// Run all up migrations
applied, err := Migrate(driver, assetMigration, migration.Up, 0)

// Remove the last 2 migrations
applied, err := Migrate(driver, assetMigration, migration.Down, 2)
```

## Writing migrations
Migrations are extremely simple to write:
- Separate your up and down migrations into different files. For example, `1_init.up.sql` and `1_init.down.sql`.
- Prefix your migration with a number or timestamp for versioning: `1_init.up.sql` or `1475813115_init.up.sql`.
- The file-extension can be anything you want, but must be present. For example, `1_init.up.sql` is valid, but
`1_init.up` is not,

Let's say we want to write our first migration to initialize the database.

In that case, we would have a file called `1_init.up.sql` containing SQL statements for the
up migration:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_data (
  id BIGINT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
)
```

We also create a `1_init.down.sql` file containing SQL statements for the down migration:
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_data
```

## Embedding migration files
We use [go-bindata](https://github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata) to embed migration files. In the
simpliest case, assuming your migration files are in `migrations/`, just run:
```
go-bindata -o bindata.go -pkg myapp migrations/
```

Then, use `AssetMigrationSource` to find the migrations:
```go
assetMigration := &migration.AssetMigrationSource{
    Asset:    Asset,
    AssetDir: AssetDir,
    Dir:      "test-migrations",
}
```

The `Asset` and `AssetDir` functions are generated by `go-bindata`.

## Using Go for migrations
Sometimes, we might be working with a database or have a situation where the query language is not expressive enough
to perform the required migrations. For example, we might have to get some data out of the database, perform some 
transformations and then write it back. For these type of situations, you can use Go for migrations.

When using Go for migrations, create a `golang.Source` using `golang.NewSource()`. Then, simply add migrations to the source
using the `AddMigration()` method. You will need to pass in the name of the migration without the extension and direction, e.g.
`1_init`. For the second parameter, pass in the direction (`migration.Up` or `migration.Down`) and for the third parameter,
pass in a function or method with this signature: `func(c *golangConfig) error` for running the migration.

If your migrations need to access configuration values or database clients, create a `golang.Config` struct using
`golang.NewConfig()`. This is concurrency-safe, and you can set values into it using `Set()` and retrieve values using `Get()`.

Finally, you need to define 2 functions:
- A function for writing or deleting an applied migration matching this signature: `func(config *golang.Config, id string, direction migration.Direction) error`
- A function for getting a list of applied migrations matching this signature: `func(config *golang.Config) ([]string, error)`

These are required for initializing the driver:
```go
driver, err := golang.New(source, updateVersion, applied, config)
```

Here's a quick example:
```go
source := golang.NewSource()

source.AddMigration("1_init", migration.Up, func(c *golang.Config) error {
    // Run up migration here
    
    // If required, you can retrieve configuration here: something := c.Get("something")
})

source.AddMigration("1_init", migration.Down, func(c *golang.Config) error {
    // Run down migration here
})

// Create config
config := golang.NewConfig()
config.Set("test", "test")

// Define functions
applied := func(c *golang.Config) ([]string, error) {
    // Return list of applied migrations
}

updateVersion := func(id string, direction migration.Direction, c *golangC.onfig) error {
    // Write or delete applied migration in storage
}

// Create driver
driver, err := golang.New(source, updateVersion, applied, config)

// Run migrations
count, err = migration.Migrate(driver, source, migration.Up, 0)
```

## TODO (Pull requests welcomed!)
- [ ] Command line program to run migrations
- [ ] MigrationSource that uses migrations from the local file system
- [ ] More drivers

## Why yet another migration library?
We wanted a migration library with the following features:
- Open to extension for all sorts of databases, not just `database/sql` drivers or an ORM.
- Easily embeddable in a Go application.
- Support for embedding migration files directly into the app.

We narrowed our focus down to 2 contenders: [sql-migrate](https://github.com/rubenv/sql-migrate)
and [migrate](https://github.com/mattes/migrate/)

`sql-migrate` leans heavily on the [gorp](https://github.com/go-gorp/gorp) ORM library to perform migrations.
Unfortunately, this means that we were restricted to databases supported by `gorp`. It is easily embeddable in a
Go app and supports embedding migration files directly into the Go binary. If database support was a bit more flexible,
we would have gone with it.

`migrate` is highly extensible, and adding support for another database is extremely trivial. However, due to it using
the scheme in the dsn to determine which database driver to use, it prevented us from easily implementing an Apache
Phoenix driver, which uses the scheme to determine if we should connect over `http` or `https`. Due to the way the
project is structured, it was also almost impossible to add support for embeddable migration files without major
changes.
